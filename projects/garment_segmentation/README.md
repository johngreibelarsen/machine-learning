Imagery for training our model are contained in the input folder. I have included to sets of data:

The folder demonstration_set contains 3 folders (purely for illustration of the data):

* original: 2 garments shown in 3 different viewpoints
* cutout: the cutouts created using Photoshop from those same two garments
* mask: the alpha-masks taken from the cutouts

The folder images_front_358 contains 358 images, all front view. Again there are 3 subfolders: original, cutout and mask as above. Please note that this dataset is just short of 1/2 GB.

I have not uploaded all 1084 images due to the size of this dataset.
